--To use this repository, download it and

Drag it onto an open profile or use Mudlet's package installer to import the the RoD_GUI.mpackage file. To get rid of it, use the package installer to uninstall it.
You can enable and disable individual items.
Right click the mapper or use Mudlet's Options -> Preferences -> Mapper -> Load Map and load the map (.dat) file. Note - you need
a) Jor'Mox's generic mapper package installed if its not already
b) And a "find prompt" may also be necessary after that.
c) You need a "map ignore %s%s.* to keep the map from pulling in the RoD compass on your room names. It should use aesatchiens map then.


Scripts use prompts to trigger most events, MSDP handles what it can.
You will need to set your prompt to default to get the used prompt or edit the prompt trigger to reflect your prompt.
If you edit the prompt trigger make sure to include <> at the end of your Fprompt for the fight tracking stuff to work!
