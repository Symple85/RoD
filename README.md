# RoD
This is a set of mudlet maps, scripts, triggers and aliases for Mudlet and Realms of Despair.
Thanks to aesatchien for his project at https://github.com/aesatchien/Rod_Mudlet

--To use this repository, download it and

use Mudlet's package installer to import the the RoD_GUI.mpackage file. To get rid of it, use the package installer to uninstall it.
You can enable and disable individual items.
use Mudlet's Options -> Preferences -> Mapper -> Load Map and load the map (.dat) file. Note - you need a) Jor'Mox's generic mapper package installed, and need to do a "map update".
b) And a "find prompt" may also be necessary after that.
c) You need a "map ignore %s%s.* to keep the map from pulling in the RoD compass on your room names. It should use aesatchiens map then.


Scripts use default prompt to activate so if at any time your having issues just type prompt default to reset most stuff

DISCLAIMER: THIS IS A WIP! I am not a pro coder so please excuse any errors and provid feedback if you can!
